                        <p>The Choisys approach to an effective Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) program for the Seaport-e community is to establish, document, execute and maintain QA and QC throughout the Program lifecycle. Our Quality Management System (QMS) is certified to the ISO 9001:2008 standard and independently assessed for compliance on an annual basis. Our QMS refers to a system that considers the three main components: quality control, quality assurance and quality improvement. Quality management is focused not only on product or service quality, but also the means to achieve it. Our QMS, therefore, uses quality assurance and control of processes, as well as products/services to achieve more consistent quality.</p>

                        <p>For each supported Task Order, we develop and tailor Quality Assurance Plans (QAP) that describe how we will control and improve quality throughout the Task order lifecycle. The purpose of the Quality Assurance Plan is to describe the systematic methods used to monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the resources to be employed. Quality activities occur throughout the life of the project and directly support the quality of services and product delivery. QAPs are developed to the specific requirements for each Task Order and tailored to support the quality of services and product delivery as required by each program. Quality objectives are established and reported on.</p>
